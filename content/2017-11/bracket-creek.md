Me and the pup took a nice little xc ski up bracket creek.  Soda is almost five
months old and this was his first ski trip and he had a blast.

We skied up to the main parking lot.  At that point, we tried a few of the
split off trails, but none were traveled enough that Soda could stay on top of
the snow.  He kept falling through so we turned around.

While soda has excellent trail poop etiquette (pooping while up to his belly
in snow in order to poop off trail) he doesn't have great downhill travel
etiquette -- lots of stopping in front of me.  This is not good for his own
safety.  However, Soda didn't get in to too much trouble because the snow was
getting super gloppy by the time we were on our way out.

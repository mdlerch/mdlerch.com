After a nice early november snow in bozeman and the bridgers and a big gear
stock up just a bit earlier, I was excited to get out for some early skiing.  I
was able to get out for a late afternoon ski at bridger bowl.

It was like a mid-season day up there with all the people and the snow.  I
hiked up to the top of pier's and skied down the trail the whole way.  Not a
very exciting ski, but was so nice to get out.  First ski on the new dynafit
bindings and dalbello boots.

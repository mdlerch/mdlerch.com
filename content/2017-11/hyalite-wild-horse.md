Family ski day up at Hyalite.  It's been really warm but we wanted to get the
little monkey out for a bit anyway.  We drove up to the reservoir "skied" out a
few miles with Soda.  I skied out and hiked back.  Kez pretty much hiked the
whole time.  The snow was either crusty or just plain ice.  Not great snow, but
nice to get out.

Soda had a great time and has been sleeping almost the whole time since we got
home.  Nice to tire him out a little.

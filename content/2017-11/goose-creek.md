Took a trip up to goose creek with Justin a couple weeks after the big early
snow in Bozeman.  I didn't have high hopes for the snow, but we really wanted
to get out especially since the forecast is for warm weather over the next
week.

First climb for my new skins.  Second trip on my dalbello lupo boots and new
dynafit radicals.  Skied my old bd drifts.

On the drive up, we saw a weasel taking down a rabbit right on goose creek road.
Rabbits are much larger than weasels.  I wouldn't have guessed that such an
event would happen unless I saw it myself.

Snow on the top was way better than I expected, and I was able to get in two
laps.  Trail down through the trees was pretty slick and I opted for the road
after the first trail section.  Snow was fast enough to make the road fun.

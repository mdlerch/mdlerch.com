### Background

A study of small land birds was conducted in the Elkhorn Mountains in the
Helena National Forest from 2003 to 2011.  From 2003-2006, these birds were
observed with the intention of performing prescribed burns to observe changes
in occupancy of these birds.  However, litigation in 2006 prevented the
prescribed burns.  Unbeknownst to the researchers, a mountain pine beetle
epidemic was about to ravage the Rocky Mountain forests.  These observations
from 2003-2006 were valuable observations of pre-epidemic bird presence.
Researchers continued bird observations from 2009 through 2011.

### Statistics

The objective is to find differences in the occupancy

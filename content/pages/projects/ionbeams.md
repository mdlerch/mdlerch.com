Before I was a statistician, I studied physics.  I worked for Dr. Dick Smith in
the ionbeams lab at Montana State.  I mostly studied structure of thin films of
transition metals on Aluminum crystal.  Some techniques I employed include
Rutherford Back Scattering and Channeling, Low Energy Ion Scattering, X-ray
Photoelectron spectroscopy, Low Energy Electron Diffraction, and others.  I
also assisted in the upkeep of a 1.2 MeV Van de Graaf accelerator and lots of
other serious physics equipment especially related to ultra-high vacuums.

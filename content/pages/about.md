Summary: About this site

My name is Michael Lerch.  I live in Bozeman, Montana.  I am a statistician.
In particular I consider myself a Bayesian.  I care and think about the
philosophy of statistics and analysis techniques a great deal--perhaps too
often when I should be just applying statistics.  I am slightly concerned about
the _data science_ and _big data_ waves.  There is no doubt that a lot of
amazing work is being done in those fields, but there is a lot of noise as well
and to some extent, an equation of statistics to making fancy plots.  I enjoy
making fancy plots as much as the next guy but there's a lot more to statistics
and data analysis than data summary.  Some related interests of mine are
[R](http://www.r-project.org), [vim](http://www.vim.org), and
[gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info).

Some of my less geeky interests are hiking, biking, skiing, hammocking, and the
outdoors in general.  Bozeman is a fun place to live.  I also enjoy playing
hockey and disc golf and going out for sushi.

This site is powered by [pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com) and I am using the theme
[tuxlite-tbs](http://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes/tree/master/tuxlite_tbs).
Most themes seem to put this information in the footer, but it's not included
in this theme so I figured I'd give credit here.

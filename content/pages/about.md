Title: About

Hey there, I'm Michael Lerch in Bozeman, Montana, USA.  I am a Bayesian
statistician.  A big fan of Dennis Lindley.  I spend way to much time tweaking
my vim config files.  I use R to do almost everything.  Except plotting.  I'll
use R for quickly making plots, but when I want to make something nice I use
gnuplot.  I also enjoy hiking, biking, skiing, hammocking, and the outdoors in
general.  I have a teeny tiny gardening plot where I grow tomatoes and
peppers.  I wish I went out for sushi more often.

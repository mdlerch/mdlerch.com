Title: About

Hey there, I'm Michael Lerch in Bozeman, Montana, USA.  I'm a statistician.
Philosophically, I am a Bayesian and a big fan of Dennis Lindley's pop book
_Understanding Uncertainty_.  I use vim to write anything and everything, and
these days that is mostly emails, R code and writeups, plus the occasional blog
post.  I'm still hooked on gnuplot and wish it hat D3.js bindings.  I enjoy
hiking, biking, skiing, hammocking, and the outdoors in general.  I have a
teeny tiny gardening plot where I grow tomatoes and peppers.  I wish I went out
for sushi more often.
